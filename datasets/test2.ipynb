       "'BROWNSVILLE, Texas  —   Authorities identified a Cuban immigrant with a long arrest history as the man who violently shanked a corrections officer in the neck. The man then stole the guard’s weapons, murdered an innocent man, and engaged police in a short but fierce gun battle that led to his death. [As Breitbart Texas reported,    Miguel Diaz Garcia, escaped from authorities by using a makeshift shank to stab a Cameron County Sheriff’s detention officer in the neck during a doctor’s visit. The inmate swam through a   lake to a nearby home and murdered the homeowner in order to steal his vehicle. The rampage ended in a deadly shootout with law enforcement in the nearby city of San Benito.   Brownsville Police Chief Orlando Rodriguez revealed that Diaz Garcia is not a stranger to law enforcement. He has a long criminal history that included multiple violent offenses including aggravated assault and terroristic threats. According to Cameron County jail records, Diaz had spent close to 500 days in custody in connection with an arrest on home burglary charges from a Brownsville case. Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio revealed to Breitbart Texas that Diaz Garcia is a Cuban immigrant who also had an immigration detainer from U. S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.  Prior to his escape, Diaz created a makeshift knife by using a toothbrush and attaching a disposable razor blade to the tip, Lucio said. The inmate was being transported to a dental office by one guard. Sheriff’s policy calls for two guards to escort an inmate, but an apparent shortage of staff led to the decision to move the inmate with only one guard.  “We still don’t know how but he was able to remove his restraints and when the guard opened the door, he charged at him using the shank to help overpower him,” Lucio said.  Weighing approximately 240 pounds and standing at more than 6 feet tall, Diaz’s size was a factor that helped him during the attack on the detention officer, said Brownsville Police Chief Orlando Rodriguez. After severely injuring the guard, Diaz stole the lawman’s duty belt and his service issued Glock 22, . 40 caliber handgun.  The man jumped into a nearby manmade lake and swam across to a nearby home. There, the man demanded the keys to a small sedan, The owner tried to calm down the agitated fugitive. Rather than listen, Diaz opened fire, fatally shooting the    Mario Martinez in front of his family.  After the shooting, Diaz drove off in the family’s vehicle until authorities spotted him. A   chase ensued ending in the nearby city of San Benito. Diaz reportedly fired multiple rounds at authorities who returned fire, fatally wounding the escaped criminal. “He was on a rampage, thankfully there are men and women in uniform who are willing to run into danger and this matter was ended without further loss of life. ” Rodriguez said. “Our condolences go to the Martinez family, we are going to do everything we can to help them. ”  Ildefonso Ortiz is an   journalist with Breitbart Texas.

       "'By the look of the renderings officially unveiled on Wednesday morning, New York’s next significant landmark may be the city’s biggest Rorschach test, too. Big, bold and   the structure, “Vessel,” stands 15 stories, weighs 600 tons and is filled with 2, 500 climbable steps. Long under wraps, it is the creation of Thomas Heatherwick, 46, an acclaimed and controversial British designer, and will rise in the mammoth Far West Side development Hudson Yards, anchoring a   plaza and garden that will not open until 2018. Some may see a jungle gym, others a honeycomb. But Stephen M. Ross, the billionaire founder and chairman of Related Companies, which is developing Hudson Yards with Oxford Properties Group, has his own nickname for “Vessel”: “the social climber. ” And the steep price tag Mr. Ross’s privately held company is paying for Mr. Heatherwick’s installation? More than $150 million. The back story of the   “Vessel” involves two men who are in step in more ways than one: a designer known for dreaming big, and a   developer who will spend whatever it takes to make a statement. Currently under construction in Monfalcone, Italy, the   and concrete pieces that make up “Vessel” are not to be assembled on site until next year, but on Wednesday, Related Companies rolled out the design with a Hudson Yards spectacle hosted by Anderson Cooper, with a performance by the Alvin Ailey dance troupe on a set that mimicked the multiple stairways inside “Vessel. ” The crowd of hundreds included Mayor Bill de Blasio. “We know ‘Vessel’ will be debated and discussed and looked at from every angle, and Thomas,” the mayor added, addressing the architect, “if you meet 100 New Yorkers, you will find 100 different opinions on the beautiful work you’ve created. Do not be dismayed. ” On a visit to New York this summer, Mr. Heatherwick, founder of the Heatherwick Studio in London, was eager to explain his design. “We had to think of what could act as the role of a landmarker,” he said. “Something that could help give character and particularity to the space. ” Mr. Heatherwick said “Vessel” was partly inspired by Indian stepwells, but he also referred to it as a climbing frame  —   what Americans would call a jungle gym  —   as well as “a Busby Berkeley musical with a lot of steps. ” The design reflects Mr. Heatherwick’s belief that city natives are always looking for their next workout. “New Yorkers have a fitness thing,” he said. (It will test many city folk who can barely climb into their Ubers, but there will be an elevator for anyone unable to reach the top.) Inside the piece, the 154 interconnecting staircases may put visitors in mind of a drawing by M. C. Escher, especially given that the   structure will have 80 viewing landings. Mr. Heatherwick’s career, as measured by his personal profile, has certainly been climbing. He gained fame for ingenious designs like his torch for the 2012 London Olympics, known as the Caldron. He is collaborating with the architect Bjarke Ingels on the design for Google’s new campus in Mountain View, Calif. and he is reimagining the home of the New York Philharmonic, David Geffen Hall, with Diamond Schmitt Architects of Toronto. But other projects have faced some downward pressure. Mr. Heatherwick’s proposal for a   bridge across the Thames River in London was held up by budget issues in July, though Mr. Heatherwick said it was moving forward again. In New York, the Hudson River island park known as Pier 55  —   funded by another   billionaire, Barry Diller  —   was stalled by a legal challenge that was rejected last week. (According to Mr. Diller, the challenge is being secretly sponsored by Douglas Durst, a real estate rival of Mr. Ross’s.) “It’s a leap of faith in terms of scale,” said Susan K. Freedman, president of the Public Art Fund, who has seen the “Vessel” renderings and likes them. “ I admire the ambition,” she added. “You can’t be small in New York. ” But Ms. Freedman had her reservations. “The bigger problem may be traffic control,” she said, given that the work will be near the already crowded High Line, the tourist attraction whose northernmost segment winds around Hudson Yards. “I think people will want to experience it. ” Thomas Woltz, of the firm Nelson Byrd Woltz, designed Hudson Yards’ Public Square and Gardens, with input from Mr. Heatherwick, as a dramatically landscaped attraction. The square will be the $200 million centerpiece of Hudson Yards’ eastern section, a   parcel with eight buildings comprising office space, retail outlets, residences and  a new cultural institution, the Shed. The eastern section  stretches from 30th to 34th Streets and from 10th to 11th Avenues, built largely on a platform over the West Side Rail Yards. Despite the name “Public Square,” Hudson Yards is a private development, and “Vessel” was commissioned and approved by a committee of one: Mr. Ross, who has kept the design models in a locked cabinet in the Related offices  —   when not allowing brief peeks to lure commercial tenants. “I have the only key,” he said with a smile. When Mr. Ross began the process of finding a piece several years ago, he first turned to five artists who are known for working in public plazas  —   and whom he declined to name  —   and asked them for detailed proposals. One of the unbuilt plans cost him $500, 000, he said, and another $250, 000. But he was unsatisfied. “Been there, seen that,” Mr. Ross said of his reaction. A Related colleague suggested Mr. Heatherwick, who had come in previously for a meeting at the company to discuss a future pavilion on the site. Mr. Heatherwick and Mr. Ross talked, and six weeks later, the designer sent a proposal. “I looked at it and said, ‘That’s it,’” Mr. Ross said. “It had everything I wanted. ” That was in 2013. “Everybody here thought I was nuts,” Mr. Ross said of his colleagues’ reactions. The idea of “Vessel” as an exclamation point toward the northern end of the High Line is part of Mr. Ross’s grand plan to make Hudson Yards the center of New York, despite its    location. “The most important place in New York is Rockefeller Center during Christmas time,” Mr. Ross said. “I wanted to have a   Christmas tree. ” One of Mr. Heatherwick’s main goals for the piece is to raise people significantly above ground level so they can see the city  —   and one another  —   in a new way. “The power of the High Line is the changed perspective on the world,” Mr. Heatherwick said. The interactive feature of “Vessel” was partly a reaction to what Mr. Heatherwick sees as previous failures in public projects: Plop art. “We’ve gotten used to these 1960s, 1970s plazas with obligatory big artworks plunked down,” he said. “Vessel” is only 50 feet in diameter at its base, rising to 150 feet at the top, meaning that it has a “small bum,” Mr. Heatherwick said, and does not take over the plaza’s ground level. The cost of the piece has ballooned from the original estimate, $75 million, Mr. Ross said. Mr. Heatherwick noted that the process of making the steel pieces was unusually complex. “We didn’t have an unlimited budget, but no corners have been cut,” Mr. Heatherwick said, adding that “Vessel” was sturdy enough to “take Hurricane Sandys. ” The price does not appear to trouble his patron. Mr. Ross has now hired Heatherwick Studio to design two residential buildings, one at Hudson Yards and one in Chelsea. For Mr. Heatherwick, “Vessel” represents his firm’s focus on doing innovative work for the public to enjoy. “I’m doing this project because it’s free, and for all New Yorkers,” he said. “I’m just itching to see a thousand people on it. ”'"

       "'Russian warships ready to strike terrorists near Aleppo 08.11.2016 | Source: Source: Mil.ru Attack aircraft of the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov get ready to strike terrorists\\' positions in the vicinity of Aleppo, sources at the Russian Defense Ministry said, RBC reports. \"Insurgents\\' attempts to break into Aleppo from outside are meaningless,\" the source said. The main task of the aircraft carrier aviation group is to strike missile and air blows on the terrorists , whose goal is to enter Aleppo. \"After the attacks on terrorists\\' positions, one will have to forget about the support for insurgents from the outside,\" the source said. The Russian group in the Mediterranean Sea consists of the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier , the heavy nuclear missile cruiser Pyotr Velikiy (Peter the Great) and large anti-submarine ships Severomorsk and Vice-Admiral Kulakov. Russia has increased intelligence activities in Syria to establish the areas, where terrorists are concentrated, as well as the routes that they use to move from one area to another. \"The militants took advantage of the humanitarian pause and regrouped their forces to prepare for a new breakthrough into the eastern part of Aleppo,\" the source added. According to the source, Russia will use new weapons during the upcoming attacks on terrorists . It was said that the Russian warships in the Mediterranean Sea will launch \"Caliber\" cruise missiles, although it was not specified which ships would be responsible for the launches.
